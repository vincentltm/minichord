## Documentation 

The best way to get to know this project is to visit the [minichord website](https://minichord.com/) which contains the documentation of the project. 

In particular it contains:

- the [user manual of the minichord](https://minichord.com/user_manual/)
- the [assembly guide of the minichord](https://minichord.com/assembly/)

This documentation is build with mkdocs and the relevant source and build script is available in the [documentation folder](https://github.com/BenjaminPoilve/MiniChord/tree/main/documentation).

## Hardware 

The hardware folder contains the necessary ressources to build a minichord.

In particular it contains: 

- the [files necessary to manufacture the PCB](https://github.com/BenjaminPoilve/MiniChord/tree/main/hardware/PCB)
- the [full BOM of the project](https://github.com/BenjaminPoilve/MiniChord/tree/main/hardware/BOM)
- the [3D enclosure files](https://github.com/BenjaminPoilve/MiniChord/tree/main/hardware/3D/rendering)
- the [keycap routing files](https://github.com/BenjaminPoilve/MiniChord/tree/main/hardware/graphics)

## Firmware

### Features in the `resonator` Branch
* **Physical Modeling Synthesis**: Integrated Mutable Instruments **Rings** resonator DSP engine (Modal, Sympathetic String, Inharmonic, and FM modes).
* **Modular SynthEngine Architecture**: Dynamic runtime switching between stock subtractive engine and physical modeling resonator.
* **Master Effects Suite**: Custom **PT2399 Lo-Fi Tape Delay**, soft overdrive/saturation, and stereo width cross-fading.
* **Generative Euclidean / Markov Sequencer**: Onboard rhythm and melody generator.
* **Expanded Web MIDI Control**: Web-based parameter tweaking via [minicontrol](https://github.com/BenjaminPoilve/MiniChord/tree/main/firmware/minicontrol).

In particular it contains: 
- the [Hex firmware](https://github.com/BenjaminPoilve/MiniChord/blob/main/firmware/firmware.hex)
- the full [PlatformIO project](https://github.com/BenjaminPoilve/MiniChord/tree/main/firmware)
- the [minicontrol software](https://github.com/BenjaminPoilve/MiniChord/tree/main/firmware/minicontrol)



## Alternative control platforms

Minichord users have developed some very cool alternative platforms that interface with the minichord. 
- the [minichord Sound Lab](https://minichorddrawn.github.io/minichord-soundlab/#play)
- [Keyandcableco's minicontrol](https://keyandcableco.github.io/minicontrol/)

Make sure to test them as they offer many alternative features!
